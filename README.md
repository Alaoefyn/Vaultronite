Im tired of writing my passwords to paper instead of trusting password managers, so here we are with Vaultronite.

Will crypted with sha256 inside local db, you can move the db to usb to usb or copy as many you need, hide the db with give a '.' to created db's name inside of code.

2- You can delete Vault's entirely without delete passwords 1 to 1 if you prefer.

3- You can manipulate your passwords names and additions both inside vaults and vaults themselves.
